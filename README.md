A financial company asks you to perform a default risk rating. They have data about historic customer  behaviour at  the  time  of  the  loan  application. Before  they  award  new  loans, they predict the default risk based on this information. You  get  access  to  detailed  data  about 250,000 loans.  The  data  contains socio-economic characteristics,  employment  information,  and  wealth  status.  Furthermore,  you  observe whether a loan of the customer defaulted in the past or not. Your task as data analyst is to predict the default risk. For this purpose, you can use classical estimation  methods  and  more  advanced unsupervised  machine  learning  methods. The ultimate goal is to develop a tool, that enables the financial company to measure default risk in an easy interpretable way.


### DATA :

- Microdata from internal records of the financial company. The data comprises information on past defaults, income, age, experience, marital status, property, employment, and residency.

- Additional data about  the  business  cycle  can  be  merged  based  on  regional information.
